This directory contains files for a total beginner to play around with Python.

* This is an interpreted language, which means you can run the program as soon as you make some changes to the file. You even don't need to compile it to run your python code.
* Python is an object-oriented programming language, everything is an object. So you won't need to declare variables at the beginning of your program.
* You also don't need to specify variables types
